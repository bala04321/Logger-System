# Implementing a Logger System with Basic API Integration
Overview: As part of this task, interns are required to develop a logger system that integrates with a basic API and utilizes a circular linked list data structure to store and display logged data on a logging screen which is operational for 8 working hours.

Key Requirements:
Logger System Implementation:
Develop a logger system capable of logging various types of events, messages, and errors.
Implement functionalities to log messages with timestamps, severity levels, and additional metadata if needed.

Basic API Integration:
Data ingestion for logger should be done by Api.
Integrate the logger system with a basic API to demonstrate data transmission and retrieval capabilities.
Design API endpoints for logging events and retrieving logged data.

Circular Linked List Data Structure:
Utilize a circular linked list data structure to store logged data efficiently.
Implement methods for adding new log entries, removing old entries when the list is full, and navigating through the list to display logged data on the logging screen.
